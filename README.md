# Accessing-Bus-Position-in-Realtime-for-Montreal-STM
The program can give you a list of the next bus of your route coming to your stop 

The code was developed for a uni course. 

The program is not perfect, but it is a very good base to understand how to access 
GTFS-reltime data. 

You need to ask for your own API key on the developpers platform of the STM

the program can be easily modified for an other city transport grid
